# Data Science Final Project October - November 2021

This is our final project for the Data Science course at Woz U/Entity.
Here in this project the goal is to find a dataset, explore it visually and analytically, analyze it, then display it.
In addition, we will also be providing a report as to what our questions were, what we found along the way, and what the conclusion was.
The datasets we found were on the kaggle website, and we used multiple resources for our coding along with exploration.
