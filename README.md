# Earthquake_Final_Project
This is my Final Project during the Data Science Program at Woz U.
We consisted of three people in my group.
We initially only wanted to explore the topic of Earthquakes - which did remain the main topic.
However, we also included other datasets.
Besides earthquakes, we also included tsunamis, tectonic plate, and earthquake stations.
In this project, we went above and beyond by exploring the data.
We wrangled it, visualized it, analyzed it, and explored some more with tons of visuals.
I hope you enjoy!
